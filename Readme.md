## Dataset Overview

The dataset utilized in this analysis is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning repository, offering valuable insights into incident management processes. Each record in the dataset represents a distinct incident, and the information encapsulated in various columns serves as the foundation for the analytical exploration provided by this dashboard.

Here is a breakdown of the essential columns employed in this analysis:

- **number:** An incident identifier, serving as a unique reference for each reported incident.
- **incident state:** Indicates the current state of the incident within the management process. This column encompasses eight levels, representing transitions from the opening to the closing of the case.
- **active:** A boolean attribute signaling whether the incident record is currently active or has been closed or canceled.
- **reassignment_count:** Represents the number of times the incident has undergone reassignment to different groups or support analysts.
- **reopen_count:** Captures the count of incidents where the resolution was rejected by the caller, leading to a reopening of the incident.
- **sys_mod_count:** Quantifies the number of updates made to the incident until the present moment.
- **made_sla:** A boolean attribute indicating whether the incident adhered to the target Service Level Agreement (SLA).
- **caller_id:** Identifies the user affected by the incident.
- **opened_by:** Identifies the user who reported the incident.
- **opened_at:** Records the date and time when the incident was initially reported by the user.
- **sys_created_by:** Identifies the user responsible for registering the incident.
- **sys_created_at:** Captures the date and time of the system's creation of the incident record.
- **sys_updated_by:** Identifies the user responsible for updating the incident, generating the current log record.
- **sys_updated_at:** Records the date and time when the incident system was last updated.
- **contact_type:** A categorical attribute indicating the means by which the incident was reported.
- **location:** Identifies the location of the place affected by the incident.
- **category:** Provides a first-level description of the affected service.
- **subcategory:** Offers a second-level description of the affected service, related to the first-level description (category).
- **u_symptom:** Describes the user's perception of service availability.
- **cmdb_ci:** (Configuration Item) An identifier used to report the affected item, though not mandatory.
- **impact:** Describes the impact caused by the incident, categorized as 1 (High), 2 (Medium), or 3 (Low).
- **urgency:** Describes the urgency informed by the user for incident resolution, with values of 1 (High), 2 (Medium), or 3 (Low).
- **priority:** Calculated by the system based on 'impact' and 'urgency.'
- **assignment_group:** Identifies the support group responsible for managing the incident.
- **assigned_to:** Identifies the user in charge of handling the incident.
- **knowledge:** A boolean attribute indicating whether a knowledge base document was used to resolve the incident.
- **u_priority_confirmation:** A boolean attribute indicating whether the priority field has been double-checked.
- **notify:** A categorical attribute indicating whether notifications were generated for the incident.
- **problem_id:** Identifies the problem associated with the incident.
- **rfc:** (Request for Change) An identifier of the change request associated with the incident.
- **vendor:** Identifies the vendor in charge of handling the incident.
- **caused_by:** Identifies the Request for Change (RFC) responsible for the incident.
- **close_code:** Identifies the resolution code of the incident.
- **resolved_by:** Identifies the user who resolved the incident.
- **resolved_at:** Records the date and time when the incident was resolved by the user (dependent variable).
- **closed_at:** Records the date and time when the incident was closed by the user (dependent variable).

This comprehensive set of columns provides a rich source of data for meaningful analysis and visualisation within the dashboard.
